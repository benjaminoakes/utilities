Utilities
=========

Small command line programs I like to have at my fingertips.  Many are useful as filters in vim, for example.

Most have a "--help" option that will display usage information, examples, etc.

Platform specific files are located in directories (such as "osx" and "linux").

NOTE: Several of these lived in a private Bazaar repository for quite a while.  I decided to break the version history when moving them to git (I think there may have been private info somewhere in there).  If you run into a problem, I still have the older versions available.
